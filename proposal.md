# Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal

## TODO: copy this file, fill it out, and push it up to your project's repo.

Dates 3/16-3/25

**My Name: Dahveyea Cowan


**Project Name:**  Port Scanner


**Is your project New or Old?** New

 
**Is your project Solo or Team?** Solo


## Description

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why**
Port Scanning is the name for the technique used to identify open ports and services available on a network host. It is sometimes utilized by security technicians to audit computers for vulnerabilities, however, it is also used by hackers to target victims. It can be used to send requests to connect to the targeted computers, and then keep track of the ports which appear to be opened, or those that respond to the request. I hope to achieve the ability to scan for ports to see if they respond and try to make it more advanced. I will be looking up more ways that I can try to improve it plus get help from others.

## Challenges I Anticipate

**List out the challenges you anticipate for completing this project**
Getting it to work on 851 Internet
Trying to scan for more ports
Trying to scan for vulnerabilities


## Skateboard

**ONE SINGLE aspect of product. Consider: build backend for SPD 1.2 front end, CRUD one resource, use API or library, authentication etc.**
Being able to scan ports on my IP Address to see if its open or close
**Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.**

## Bike
**ONE additional features that get you closer to your idealized product. Examples: CRUD 2nd resource, add comments, API use, authentication, library use**
Trying to make where I can Ping the ports to see if their available
## Car
**ONE additional feature**
ICMP Scanning used for identifying active devices and determining whether ICMP can pass through a firewall.
